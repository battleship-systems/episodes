3:03 "But you got to realize that the amount of ~~volts~~ **current** that actually flows through the indicator is in the ~~millivolt~~ **milliamp** range. It's not enough to light up a lamp, a circuit, not enough to turn on a motor. Another thing you got to realize is that a neon bulb changes the waveform of the current going through it. The neon bulb only ignites when the ~~current~~ **voltage** is at its peaks, whether that be peaking positive or negative."
